=Getting Started with ToCollege Source Code=

= Checking Out =
Please note that this project is NOT using Google Code anymore. Please checkout the [http://github.com/jdwyah/tocollege.net/tree/master project source on GitHub]

git clone git://github.com/jdwyah/tocollege.net.git

If you don't know, don't want, don't care about git. You can just click 'Download' from the page to download a zip file.

Sorry about the change, but I couldn't take Google Code anymore. Any change to the wiki made me need to reset the entire repository. 

= Project Name =

The book mentions that you should name the project "ProGWT-ReadOnly" but then the launch configurations refer to "ProGWT". It will work to change the launch configurations, but changing the project name is easier. If you're getting it from GitHub it will be called tocollege.net. Renaming to ProGWT is a fine option here too. 






= Old Issues =
(shouldn't exist in trunk)




= Installing GWT Maven Jars (old!) =
(git trunk should get these straight from maven central repo!)

First off I should note is that, if you want to rock with the version from the time of the book, you can checkout tag 'release_0_1_0' instead of 'trunk'. This tag runs with GWT: 1.5.0-M1, whereas trunk uses: 1.5.0.RC1. In general I'd stick with trunk, but there will be some differences from the book.

At the time the book was written, there were no versions of GWT in central repos. Unfortunately even though GWT is now in central repos, it will *not* work to use them, since in order to get hosted mode to work you need to have the DLL's in your local repository (right next to the gwt-dev jar) and the central poms aren't setup like that. 

To make this happen, the source includes some little install scripts. They perform a mvn:install commands, then copy the DLL's (or lib's for Linux/Mac) into your local repository. So that's why you need to do this local Maven install, rather than standard pull from central repo. 


The install scripts are located in Setup/maven/gwt. To make this happen just copy the install file for your platform into the directory created after you've downloaded the GWT zip file for your system. http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/download.html. Then run it *with* *an* *argument* of the version, eg "./install-mac 1.5.0.RC1".

From the book:
{{{
cd workspace/ProGWT-ReadOnly/Setup/maven/gwt
chmod a+x install*
cp install-windows /downloads/gwt-windows-0.0.2030/
cd /downloads/gwt-windows-0.0.2030/
./install-windows 1.5.0-M1
}}}
_for latest release of GWT use 1.5.0.RC1 as the version argument!_

== Special Windows User Notes ==
For windows: 
The chmod command does not work in the normal Windows cmd.exe (Command Line Window) if you have permissions problems running the command you'll need to set them through explorer. (What's the DOS command?)

The "install-win.cmd" file is for the  in the normal Windows cmd.exe (Command Line Window)
The "install-win" file is for cygwin.







== GWT-Log ==

If you get:

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ERROR] BUILD ERROR
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Failed to resolve artifact.

Missing:
----------

1) com.allen_sauer.gwt.log:gwt-log:jar:1.5.1




Change pom.xml:

<dependency>
        <groupId>com.allen_sauer.gwt.log</groupId>
        <artifactId>gwt-log</artifactId>
        <version>1.5.1</version>
</dependency>

to 

<dependency>
        <groupId>com.allen_sauer.gwt.log</groupId>
        <artifactId>gwt-log</artifactId>
        <version>1.5.6</version>
</dependency>

r93 seems to have a mismatch between the pom.xml and install-all script. Sorry!!
