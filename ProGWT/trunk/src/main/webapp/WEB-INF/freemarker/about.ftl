    ToCollege.net was conceived in September 2007 and went live in February 2008. It was created by one developer working about 50% (writing a 350 page book and paying the bills with consulting takes up a considerable amount of time!) so it represents about three months of development work with GWT, Spring & Hibernate.
  	<p>
  	The book was written because I was fed up with books that seemed like annotated version of javadocs. On the other end were the abstract architectural tracts which might have made for good reading, but they certainly didn’t give me a head start on the architecture. I wanted to see how these technologies worked when used for non-trivial applications. I wanted to see ugly problems and their solutions. What I wanted was a look at the source code of a modern web application.
  	<p>
  	So that's what I wrote and that's why the source code of this site is publicly available.
